I guess I'm the first file and pretty confident.
Be confident,
be active,
be in the present,
don't overthink,
and don't make up the stories in your head.
don't assume things, be clear about what you want in your life as well as from what things you need to keep distance.
do not be a fake guy, tell them on their face.
while being nice to people and caring about them is what led you down here to this very moment.

A lil reminder from me to myself
